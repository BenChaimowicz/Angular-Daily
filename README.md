This is my first Angular project. I decided to create a tool that will help me organize and analyze my time in order to make better use of it. This is it.

As this is my own project, I am using this to learn the system and having fun doing it.

To do:
* add timers to represent wanted activity time limit.
* rig to online database.
* 90% of the actual work + figuring out how to do it. :)
