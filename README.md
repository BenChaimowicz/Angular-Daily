# Dailies

This is my first real Angular project. I decided to create a tool that will help me organize and analyze my time in order to make better use of it. This is it.

As this is my own project, I am using this to learn the system and have fun doing it.

To do:
* add timers to represent wanted activity time limit - DONE.
* create a "new daily" input group. - DONE.
* recode inputs into angular form model. - DONE.
* set up routing. - DONE.
* integrate Bootstrap by twitter. - DONE.
* redesign the daily component to better display all details.
* add stats and scores, to keep track of goal achievements over time.
* rig to online database.
